## Privacy and Z2K
Let's face it, when you are putting your thoughts, beliefs, writings, and daily logs all into one central core system, you are putting your entire identity at risk. We know, because we face that issue ourselves. Thus it is critically important for us to emphasize our philosophy behind privacy. 

### 1. Privacy is Job One
That's the most important bullet. Before anything else, privacy is the first and foremost decision in all design designs.
- If we don't have strong confidence we can protect the privacy, we just don't do it. If it is a barely tolerable risk we make disclosures.
- Our plugins never assume data should be pushed somewhere, only data should be pulled into the system.
- We wrote this document before we published any code to the community. Privacy is in our DNA.

### 2. Full Disclosure
We deeply believe the full disclosure is a crucial step to understanding privacy. Frankly, it is a huge risk to even have a system that pulls together all this information. And even if that negates the entire idea of Z2K, it is our job to put out that risk at the onset. 
- Our plugins are open source. If we ever were to make money off of Z2K (not our goal), we would make certified code reviews be one of our first expenses.
- Using Obsidian is dangerous - but we do trust their developers. But be aware, if they make a mistake, you are at risk - like with any program.
- Using Obsidian Sync or some other online system is even more dangerous - just like dropbox, etc can be. 
- Using 3rd party plugins is even _more_ dangerous - we suggest that you use extreme caution before installing _any_ of them, including all of the Z2K plugins. It is just too easy to slip in some backdoor code. Eventually someone will. 
- Using 3rd party plugins that haven't been approved for community use is beyond dangerous, it is just downright irresponsible. Thus if you see _anybody's_ plugins for manual installation or beta release, unless you are a developer, we don't recommend extreme caution - rather, we beg for you to run the other way. 

### 3. Commitments
We deeply commit to a bevy of core goals when it comes to privacy. Sure, they are not legally binding, and #2 requires us to tell you that - but we still make them. It is not just the _right_ thing to do, but the critical thing to do if privacy is our Job One.

### 4. Safeguards
We want to tell you about all of the safeguards we have and are planning to put in place to best assure your privacy is maintained.
- We strongly maintain control of the source code. No externally written code can be submitted automatically. 
- Every piece of code is open source. That doesn't make it safe, perhaps even more unsafe, but one way to boldly claim that everything we do is visible.
