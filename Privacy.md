## Privacy and Z2K
Let's face it, when you are putting your thoughts, beliefs, writings, and daily logs all into one central core system, you are putting your entire identity at risk. We know, because we face that issue ourselves. Thus it is critically important for us to emphasize our philosophy behind privacy. 

### 1. Privacy is Job One
That's the most important bullet. Before anything else, privacy is the first and foremost decision in all design designs.

### 2. Full Disclosure
We deeply believe the full disclosure is a crucial step to understanding privacy. Frankly, it is a huge risk to even have a system that pulls together all this information. And even if that negates the entire idea of Z2K, it is our job to put out that risk at the onset. 

### 3. Commitments
We deeply commit to a bevy of core goals when it comes to privacy. Sure, they are not legally binding, and #2 requires us to tell you that - but we still make them. It is not just the _right_ thing to do, but the critical thing to do if privacy is our Job One.

### 4. Safeguards
We want to tell you about all of the safeguards we have and are planning to put in place to best assure your privacy is maintained.
